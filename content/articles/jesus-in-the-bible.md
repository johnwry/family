# Jesus in the Bible

Posted on [March 28, 2020](https://thewrys.redbiblica.org/jesus-in-the-bible/) by [John Wry](https://thewrys.redbiblica.org/author/johnwry/)

## Is Christ central to the Scriptures

The Holy Scriptures, the Bible is a compilation of 66 books written over a period of about 1500 years (1400BC – 95AD). Penned by over 40 people in 3 different languages from varied walks of life and living under different circumstances; in wealth, in poverty, in prison, in the palace, in Greece, in Jerusalem, in Babylon and everywhere in between. The amazing thing is that although there are many writers there are no contradictions. One central message and everyone is agreed on that.

Jesus says He was written about by Moses, in the Pentateuch. [Galatians 3:24](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gal 3.24) states the Law was a tutor to lead us to Christ.

> He is the image of the invisible God,
> the firstborn over all creation.
> For everything was created **by Him,**
> in heaven and on earth,
> the visible and the invisible,
> whether thrones or dominions
> or rulers or authorities—
> all things have been created **through Him** and **for Him**.
> He is before all things,
> and by Him all things hold together.
>
> [Colossians 1:15-17 HCSB](https://biblia.com/bible/hcsb/Col 1.15-17)

What did Jesus say about Himself in the Scriptures?

> “Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish **but to fulfill.** For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
>
> [Matthew 5:17-18](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt 5.17-18)

> You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is **these that bear witness of me** . . . For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; **for he wrote of me**.
>
> [John 5:39](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.39), [46](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.46)

> And He answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: *the* BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, *the* lame walk, *the* lepers are cleansed, and *the* deaf hear, *the* dead are raised up, *the* POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
>
> [Luke 7:22](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 7.22)

This verse clearly shows that He is the One who came to fulfill Scripture. There are hundreds of prophesies about Christ, most have been fulfilled. They have always been fulfilled literally. Therefore it is to presume that future prophesies will also be fulfilled literally to fulfill what the Scriptures say.

> Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, **that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.**” Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
>
> [Luke 24:44-45](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 24.44-45)

## The Prophets

## The Psalms

We saw earlier that the first five books talk about Christ. What Psalms is He talking about here? It seems rather subjective to pick verses in the Psalms, because they are in the poetic genre. Many verses sound like it could be Jesus but who’s to say they aren’t just talking about something similar?. Can we know for sure? I submit to you we most certainly can because the New Testament Scriptures comment on the Psalms.

Psalm 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 51, 53, 55, 62, 68, 69, 72, 78, 82, etc etc…clic below to see a list.

How can we know, for instance, Psalm 22 is specifically about Christ?

[Psalm 22:1](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps 22.1) is fulfilled by Jesus and written down by [Matthew 27:46](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt 27.46). Perhaps at this point saying that just because Jesus said those words they have to be prophetic. But, Psalm 22 is quoted all through the New Testament and used in reference to Christ. [Psalm 22:7](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps 22.7) is quoted and fulfilled in [Matthew 27:43](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt 27.43). [Psalm 22:18](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps 22.18) is quoted and fulfilled and recorded in all 4 Gospel accounts. [Psalm 22:16-17](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps 22.16-17) is quoted and fulfilled by Christ and written in John. [Psalm 22:22](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps 22.22) is quoted in [Heb 2:12](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb 2.12) referring to Christ.

## The exilic books

Daniel, Ezekiel and Zachariah and Jeremiah are full of prophecies regarding Christ’s first coming and second coming and new covenant promises to Israel fulfilled literally on earth through Christ. We see the glorified Christ.

## The New Testament

He is the Word (logos) ([John 1:1-3](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 1.1-3)). ([John 5:39](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.39), [46](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.46))

The Gospel – which is about Christ and His work of dying on the cross for our sins and rising again is according to the Scriptures ([1 Cor 15:1-4](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1 Cor 15.1-4)).

The Holy Spirit was sent to us to teach us all things pertinent to Christ and the Father. He works hand in hand with the Scriptures.

## In Conclusion

I doubt it could be stressed enough though, the Scriptures are all about Christ from beginning to end. The Scriptures are the means to know Christ by the teaching of the Holy Spirit.

> Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself **in all the Scriptures.**
>
> [Luke 24:27](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 24.27)

So, how do you view the Bible? Is Jesus the central figure? To truly know and understand the Scriptures is to know Christ since they Scriptures teach us of Him.
