# Connections – chances for relationships

Recently we were invited for lunch to the Leyla’s. Juan and his wife are missionaries from Argentina and Juan is the director of Word of Life in Bolivia.

We met the Leylas years before at the church we both attended.

Recently our son Jg and their son Andres met at university and have become good friends.

In my role now as director of the 3D school in Cochabamba, I realize the contacts are important but moreso these opportunities can be turned into relationships with people that are beyond the ministerial liaisons.

We’re grateful for the connection but more hopeful in the friendship that might result centered around the person and work of Christ.
