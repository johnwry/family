Rachel is our social butterfly. She loves people. She loves laughing and social events and sports. She does not love school and particularly homeschool where she is the only student.

So you can imagine she is looking forward to next semester, beginning 9th grade at Christian Life Academy a school John’s grandpa Earl started in Franklin, PA back in the 80’s. The standards are fairly high so she is nervous about being on level. Please pray for her as she diligently prepares during the next several months and that she would be ready for the challenge ahead.
