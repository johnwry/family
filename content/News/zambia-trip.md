As I sit here in Lusaka, Zambia, and wait for my plane to go home tomorrow, I wanted to make sure I updated you with a few comments and a video.
What a great experience this has been! People are Zambia are so friendly and passionate. They EXPRESS their feelings (good and bad). They have no problem telling you what they are thinking.
The workshop was held at a church in Kasama, Zambia some 11 hours from Lusaka by car. 

We put [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj3vLBbd8Y) together for you. We hope you like it! (Please subscribe so you get notified when we post new videos!). Leave your comments and questions below!


God’s abundant blessings upon you,

John
