# About us

We are a family that has felt called of God to full-time service in missions. John grew up a missionary kid and followed the Lord’s calling into missions since 1999 serving in studio recording (MMStudio) and radio work ([Rasio Mosoj Chaski)](https://www.mosojchaski.org/en/). After Nelly and John were married in 2000, they continued serving together and later in 2001 headed for Santa Cruz, Bolivia to work with [Hebron Theological Seminary](https://www.sthebron.org/), to serve with John’s grandparents (Glennie and Marilyn). In 2002, John, together with his grandfather founded an online Bible school ([Red Bíblica](https://www.redbiblica.org/)).

After about 7 years with Red Bíbica, we began praying about a more personalized ministry through discipleship.

One year later, the Lord led us to [Disciple Makers Multiplied ](http://www.dm2usa.org/)(Dm2). In 2008, we joined and continue to the present to serve with them.
