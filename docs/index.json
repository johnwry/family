John grew up a missionary kid and followed the Lord’s calling into missions since 1999 serving in studio recording (MMStudio) and radio work (Rasio Mosoj Chaski). After Nelly and John were married in 2000, they continued serving together and later in 2001 headed for Santa Cruz, Bolivia to work with Hebron Theological Seminary, to serve with John’s grandparents (Glennie and Marilyn). In 2002, John, together with his grandfather founded an online Bible school (Red Bíblica). After about 7 years with Red Bíbica, we began praying about a more personalized ministry through discipleship. One year later, the Lord led us to Disciple Makers Multiplied (Dm2). In 2008, we joined and continue to the present to serve with them.","title":""},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/articles/discipulado-y-cc3d/","tags":null,"text":"lo que me han sido de apoyo en mi caminar, algo en común - han sido discipulados Mat 4:19 Y les dijo*: «Vengan en pos de Mí, y Yo los haré pescadores de hombres».

Es un año intensivo, diseñado como un programa para preparar a jóvenes adultos para una vida de servicio a Jesucristo en la universidad, la carrera y más allá\". El discipulado es costoso e implica entrenar, aprender e internalizar lo que se estudia de la Palabra de Dios para comunicarlo a otros. Hacer tareas, escribir papeles y tener plazos son todas habilidades para la vida que debes aprender. Esto es parte de tu desarrollo y entrenamiento, no solo para la vida, sino también para confiar en el Señor. Con la vida de Pedro, Jesús le permitió fallar muchas, muchas veces. El punto es este: creemos que a los estudiantes se les debe dar oportunidades para fallar. Necesitas que te den oportunidades para sentirte mal equipado. Necesitas experimentar situaciones que son incómodas o parecen imposibles. ¿De qué otra manera vas a aprender a confiar en Dios por lo imposible? Esta vida tendrá pruebas. Hacer el discipulado es en realidad inscribirse para más dificultades y pruebas, por lo que también podrías aprender eso desde el principio, donde tendrás un sistema de apoyo de creyentes para ayudarte a través de todo.

This is the language the New Testament was written in and is very helpful to have a grasp for Bible study. It just so happens that the invited teacher was not able to attend and it was a daunting task for John to take on. Yet God gave peace to proceed and we decided to move forward with the module. God was good and we feel it was a very productive week. A couple of students expressed how fun it was.

After spending the day teaching at CC3D, Nelly took John to get a nice leather bag for his iPad (50% off at the store because it’s John’s birthday).

He is faithful, loving and ever patient as He interacts with us. I would like to sum up some of the main events in our life this year as a testimony and reminder of that. We arrived back in Bolivia in August 2021 with the purpose of setting up a gap year training center. By January we were well on our way towards having a place picked out and beginning to prepare it as a place For learning. We were also involved with starting a local gathering of believers. These were instrumental in getting the place ready as well. Classes began on the first day of February with 5 students. One week later we had 7 and ended up with 8. From February to early May (13 weeks) we studied through 11 modules. The Stranger on the Road to Emmaus Knowing God (From Eden to Calvary) Romans 1-8 Biblical Discipleship Old Testament Panorama Galatians Colossians Introduction to Greek Life of Christ Panorama Bible Study Methods Romans 9-16 (away) Several (7) teachers were involved helping with the teaching that came from different parts of Bolivia. These were trained by DM2 attendees through workshops done between about 2008-2019. Three teachers were from a local church in Cochabamba. All in all (though not without challenges) we have seen and tasted the program to be highly effective in training young people for one year that prepares them for the rest of their lives. Roughly about 330 hours of intense Bible teaching was done this year. Due to the fact that we closed the school halfway through this year, most of the students plan to return next year to complete their studies. As you all know by now, our son went to be with the Lord. We’ve been advised to take time off the field to heal. We will plan to be in the US and Canada until around the end of the year and return in time for next year’s classes to begin in February. I will leave you with some testimonies from students regarding CC3D (3D training center). I ran them through Google translate without editing. “My name is Belen Soza, I am 19 years old, it all started with an ambition to know and be able to learn, I felt the need that there was something more to learn, something more beautiful to know, so God gave me the opportunity to study Bible one year, where the study of the bible was done in a different way, because each verse was studied in detail, the idea of being able to go to a place where the bible is studied intensively fascinated me, since that was what I wanted so much , God opened the doors in a supernatural way and everything went according to his will. The months that God allowed me to be in the CC3D have been a great blessing in my life, since I have learned a lot and have been able to grow in the knowledge of God, but I still have a long way to go, a desire that I have in me is to be pleasant to my lord, in everything I do and every day learn more of his word and in the months that I was there I have been able to fulfill part of that wish. Being in the CC3D I have been able to learn a lot from the Bible, since we have studied the word of God in the way in which it has been revealed and how God has wanted to communicate towards the human being, I have been able to appreciate the importance that the cultural, historical, social context at the time of studying the scriptures, all of this has been very helpful to now see Christian life from another perspective and to be able to live it in a way that God wants me to live it, not as a false religion, but as a true relationship of a Father towards his children. Being able to know God in the essence and simplicity with which it is shown through the scriptures, makes it possible for us to understand his love for humanity, revealed through JESUS CHRIST, since he left nothing hidden, but on the contrary, it is revealed clear way for all humanity and thus live the way He wants us to live through FAITH knowing our identity in CHRIST, counting on the blessings we already have for the work of CHRIST, all this makes our look above of what is on this earth and points only to Christ, what this produces in us is the work of God and takes away the focus on our strengths or our abilities, it leads us to realize that our sufficiency comes from CHRIST, that in Him we are already complete and our focus is no longer on what we can do, but on what He has already done on the Cross and that is what the Christian life of living by faith is all about, faith in what Christ has already done, this makes me love to a living and true God who he has already done everything for me, there is no need to make an effort to please him, since being in Christ I am pleasing to the father, the word of God produces its transcendental effect in our lives, it produces a genuine change, it produces a passion for preaching the gospel, teaching and disciple others, tell them our condition outside of God and give them the solution that is through Faith in the Gospel, so that they know a just God, a God of Grace and this truth spreads transforming religious lives or lives without God , in fruitful, sincere lives, full of faith living in the GRACE that we were called to live.” —- “My name is Silvia Herboso Meneses, I live in Cochabamba-Bolivia, an older single woman, a believer in Christ Jesus for 32 years. This year God blessed me by studying at the CC3D Study Center, it was a great blessing to study the blessed word of God verse by verse, to deepen the super abundant richness of God’s Grace!!! Many truths of his Word remained in my mind and heart, among them I will cite the understanding that “I was a sinner without hope” but, Jesus in his infinite LOVE and GRACE paid the price of my REDEMPTION!!! He gave me hope by including myself in his family, the family of God. I understood that: “EVERYTHING is by GRACE.” We are justified through FAITH in Christ Jesus. ([Romans 3:21-31](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom 3.21-31)) The book of Romans is a great blessing for my life, I understood many things about our sinfulness, and God’s PERFECT JUSTICE, I would lack many sheets to write, all the profound truths I learned in CC3D, “Romans, Galatians, Philemon, Colossians, etc. By meditating and savoring the Richness of the WORD of GOD! Therefore, I do not hesitate to recommend and encourage anyone to be part of DM2 and CC3D studies, because for me it was BLESSING and SPIRITUAL growth.” —- We thank God for the privilege it has been to be a small part of what He did in the lives of these people. We ask your continued prayers as we continue to heal and look ahead to the future. God’s grace and peace be with you.

First we spent a couple of months just visiting family and friends. We were able to pick up a vehicle + RV combo and drive around the American countryside…that was fun! Following this time, God opened the doors for us to be able to go to 3DTC in Beaumont, Texas. Our time there started in September and went until the 10th of December. Nelly and I traded places during this time. I was able to stay at home while she went to study full-time at 3D. By study full-time I mean 8:00am to 5:00pm with a short lunch break. God uses amazing methods to teach us (if we’re teachable). We want to be teachable. In fact, we realize we need to be teachable, however we’re not always with the correct mindset to be taught and lessons are missed or delayed it seems. During this time God prepared a special lesson for me. It all took place at home with our son, Joshua. He is in first grade, going on high-school…except he can’t read so much and hates writing his letters. Actually that sounds familiar to me as a high-school student. The thing is, it was my turn to homeschool Joshua. Usually Nelly does the teaching at home and excels at it while keeping the home in tip-top shape. I am not really sure how she does it all - maybe she’s not all human. Anyways, back to school with Joshua…it was such a learning experience…for me. I hope he learned a bit too but mostly, I believe, it was me learning. Not only was I educated in how much kids learn these days in first grade but the online method as well. I remember programming our Learning Management System back in Red Biblica days and though it was ahead in its time, online learning these days has progressed so far. The point it, this new environment I was in was the perfect setting for me to learn a very important lesson. Discipleship should begin at home. Why? Because so many foundations are laid in first grade, even earlier. Concepts like nouns, verbs, counting, summing and addition are some of the blocks that are set in place. To the degree in which they are understood will greatly determine the future ability to build on later. At the same time, and being christians, we try to teach our children about the Bible. Yet it has become evident to me of the confusions that are laid at this very early age. Bible stories are actually taught as human heroes to become like. Jesus is taught as the one to imitate in His perfections and the Fruit of the Spirit is set as something attainable if we want it hard enough. So, it’s no wonder when we were discussing going to Heaven with my son, his answer revealed his dependence on his goodness (efforts to be good) and eternal life was a reward. I learned how important it is to disciple our kids early on. Let’s not presume that just because our kids give us the right answers regarding David and Goliath or Noah and the ark or God in creation that they understand the basics of God’s perfect character, love and justice and our (children included) sinfulness and need for a savior. The Gospel is not a magical phrase kids repeat or memorize as a first grade lesson. It requires understanding the purpose for the Gospel, the cost of the Gospel and the results of believing the Gospel. Teaching Bible stories with the purpose of teaching heroes to behave like is confusing if one does not understand the basics that need to be laid early on. You don’t learn about summing numbers before you learn to count. It is senseless to think sentences can be formed before learning letters. In the same way, I learned that my job as a parent begins early on, presenting building blocks of life that later will be built on. Our christian education is presuming too much if they think teaching the Fruit of the Spirit to first graders as the way to behave. It’s like starting with equations before learning greater than, less than or equal to. The basic concepts need to be laid first before talking about how a christian should live. Equations are taught upon basic concepts not something to memorize and repeat. So to sum this up, I have come to realize that the reason much of our discipleship training at the 3D center is unteaching and removing false understandings that have been incorrectly taught in church. This is why young people are better trained that adults unfortunately. It’s because adults have so much more they have learned that is incorrect. I am an excelent example of this. I was serving with all my heart as a missionary without even clearly understanding the gospel message. Clarity of the gospel does not come by chance. It does not come by using cliche’s that allude to truth for fear of not offending anyone. Placing trust on someone to bump into truth on their own is only leading people astray. Discipleship is not so much about ability or talent but about trust in the God of the message. Discipleship needs to start laying out concepts before memorizing christian phrases. Christian phrases can be built upon concepts like equations are built on the concept of greater than or less than. Unless we teach concepts we are setting up kids to be deaf to understanding and all too familiar with meaningless words. I’m grateful for this time of learning. I pray that I can learn to apply this, especially in the lives of my children and that I will not presume they understand concepts just because they give the right answers.","title":"Discipleship starts at home"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"A quick note including some verses about God’s goodness","keywords":null,"link":"/articles/goodness/","tags":null,"text":"Ever doubted God’s goodness?

Penned by over 40 people in 3 different languages from varied walks of life and living under different circumstances; in wealth, in poverty, in prison, in the palace, in Greece, in Jerusalem, in Babylon and everywhere in between. The amazing thing is that although there are many writers there are no contradictions. One central message and everyone is agreed on that. Jesus says He was written about by Moses, in the Pentateuch. [Galatians 3:24](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gal 3.24) states the Law was a tutor to lead us to Christ. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For everything was created by Him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities— all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and by Him all things hold together. [Colossians 1:15-17 HCSB](https://biblia.com/bible/hcsb/Col 1.15-17) What did Jesus say about Himself in the Scriptures? “Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished. [Matthew 5:17-18](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt 5.17-18) You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that bear witness of me . . . For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. [John 5:39](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.39), [46](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.46) And He answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM. [Luke 7:22](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 7.22) This verse clearly shows that He is the One who came to fulfill Scripture. There are hundreds of prophesies about Christ, most have been fulfilled. They have always been fulfilled literally. Therefore it is to presume that future prophesies will also be fulfilled literally to fulfill what the Scriptures say. Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, [Luke 24:44-45](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 24.44-45) The Prophets The Psalms We saw earlier that the first five books talk about Christ. What Psalms is He talking about here? It seems rather subjective to pick verses in the Psalms, because they are in the poetic genre. Many verses sound like it could be Jesus but who’s to say they aren’t just talking about something similar?. Can we know for sure? I submit to you we most certainly can because the New Testament Scriptures comment on the Psalms. Psalm 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 51, 53, 55, 62, 68, 69, 72, 78, 82, etc etc…clic below to see a list.

The exilic books Daniel, Ezekiel and Zachariah and Jeremiah are full of prophecies regarding Christ’s first coming and second coming and new covenant promises to Israel fulfilled literally on earth through Christ.

([John 5:39](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.39), [46](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John 5.46)) The Gospel – which is about Christ and His work of dying on the cross for our sins and rising again is according to the Scriptures ([1 Cor 15:1-4](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1 Cor 15.1-4)). The Holy Spirit was sent to us to teach us all things pertinent to Christ and the Father. He works hand in hand with the Scriptures. Below I will post a list a guy by the name of Philip Nation shared (many thanks to Philip for putting it together)… Christ in the Bible Genesis – Creator \u0026 promised Redeemer Exodus – the Passover Lamb Leviticus – High Priest Numbers – water in the desert Deuteronomy – He becomes the curse for us Joshua – Commander of the army of the Lord Judges – delivers us from injustice Ruth – our Kinsman-Redeemer 1 Samuel – all in one, He is the Prophet/Priest/King 2 Samuel – King of grace \u0026 love 1 Kings – a Ruler greater than Solomon 2 Kings – the powerful prophet 1 Chronicles – Son of David that is coming to rule 2 Chronicles – the King who reigns eternally Ezra – Priest proclaiming freedom Nehemiah – the One who restores what is broken down Esther – Protector of his people Job – Mediator between God and man Psalms – our song in the morning and in the night Proverbs – our wisdom Ecclesiastes – our meaning for life Song of Solomon – Author of faithful love Isaiah – Suffering Servant Jeremiah – the weeping Messiah Lamentations – He assumes God’s wrath for us Ezekiel – Son of Man Daniel – the stranger in the fire with us Hosea – faithful husband even when we run away Joel – He is sending His Spirit to His people Amos – delivers justice to the oppressed Obadiah – Judge of those who do evil Jonah – the greatest missionary Micah – He casts our sin into the sea of forgetfulness Nahum – proclaims future world peace we cannot even imagine Habakkuk – crushes injustice Zephaniah – the Warrior who saves Haggai – restores our worship Zechariah – prophesies a Messiah pierced for us Malachi – sun of righteousness who brings healing Matthew – the Messiah who is King Mark – the Messiah who is a Servant Luke – the Messiah who is a Deliverer John – the Messiah who is a God in the flesh Acts – the Spirit who dwells in His people Romans – the righteousness of God 1 Corinthians – the power and love of God 2 Corinthians – He is the down payment of what’s to come Galatians – He is our very life Ephesians – the unity of our church Philippians – the joy of our life Colossians – holds the supreme position in all things 1 Thessalonians – our comfort in the last days 2 Thessalonians – our returning King 1 Timothy – Savior of the worst sinners 2 Timothy – leader of the leaders Titus – foundation of truth Philemon – our Mediator Hebrews – our High Priest James – He matures our faith 1 Peter – our hope in times of suffering 2 Peter – the One who guards us from false teaching 1 John – source of all fellowship 2 John – God in the flesh 3 John – source of all truth Jude – protects us from stumbling Revelation – King of Kings and Lord of Lords, The Alpha and the Omega, The Beginning and the End, and He is coming again and the One who makes all things new. In Conclusion I doubt it could be stressed enough though, the Scriptures are all about Christ from beginning to end. The Scriptures are the means to know Christ by the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures. [Luke 24:27](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke 24.27) So, how do you view the Bible? Is Jesus the central figure? To truly know and understand the Scriptures is to know Christ since they Scriptures teach us of Him.","title":"Jesus in the Bible"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Wrapping up homeschool","keywords":null,"link":"/news/rachels-wrap/","tags":null,"text":"Rachel’s Wrap Posted on April 24, 2019 by John Wry Rachel is our social butterfly. She loves people. She loves laughing and social events and sports. She does not love school and particularly homeschool where she is the only student. So you can imagine she is looking forward to next semester, beginning 9th grade at Christian Life Academy a school John’s grandpa Earl started in Franklin, PA back in the 80’s. The standards are fairly high so she is nervous about being on level. Please pray for her as she diligently prepares during the next several months and that she would be ready for the challenge ahead.","title":"Rachel’s Wrap"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Wrapping up homeschool","keywords":null,"link":"/news/zambia-trip/","tags":null,"text":"Headed home from a great first experience in Zambia! Posted on November 3, 2019 by John Wry As I sit here in Lusaka, Zambia, and wait for my plane to go home tomorrow, I wanted to make sure I updated you with a few comments and a video. What a great experience this has been! People are Zambia are so friendly and passionate. They EXPRESS their feelings (good and bad). They have no problem telling you what they are thinking. The workshop was held at a church in Kasama, Zambia some 11 hours from Lusaka by car. We put this short video together for you. We hope you like it! (Please subscribe so you get notified when we post new videos!). Leave your comments and questions below! God’s abundant blessings upon you, John Here are some testimonies from the workshop. Please note, we’ve copied them exactly as they were written. Testimonies Bible Study Methods Zambia, 2019 In this workshop, I have learnt the following: God paid the full price for my salvation How to study the Word of God How to observe, interpret and apply the Word of God in my life. I have come to understand Psalms 23 in a more profound way How to let the Scripture speak to me and not to add to the Scripture my perceived ideas. yourAnd many more* Humphrey Mwbanga I thank God for this workshop which has helped me know and understand how to prepare Bible study in the simplest way. Before, I never know that observation, interpretation and application are essential in preparing Bible study. Bridget M Nkhonjera This workshop has helped me how to conduct a Bible study. How to read the Bible and understand Bible passages and it also to avoid taking my experience and my culture in the Bible. Jonathan Mwango It is an eyes opened for me in the Bible study It has made me grow on the Bible study preparation lesson It has inspired in me in Bible study. Sibanse Lovemore B Isaiah N Kabuia In this workshop I have learned a lot of things. I wasn’t know how to do Bible working and researching, but through this workshop my mind is now open. I can do the whole so objectively. There iss my prayer that may the all mighty God continue blessing you and give you more knowledge. Daniel S Chisanga In this workshop we have very much glad for everything we have learnt and we are pray it will take us a long way in our churches when we are going back. Webster Mbulo There was a time, pastor Chishimba, invited me for this workshop and was even telling me how the importance of DM2 was. And upon attending it I was interesting in it, now I don’t want to miss future workshops. Joseph K Sikazkie God used this workshop to help me how to clearly observe, interpret and apply the Word of God. This has prepared me how to understand God’s word properly and wonderfully. This has helped not to rush in preparation of Bible study and give a misleading words. Sishwati R. Mubita God has really helped me know the right way to follow when teaching Bible study as before I was teaching it all wrongly. Francis Sitali I was ignorant how to prepare a message. But through DM2 teachings I have learned how to prepare for Bible study or Sunday service. This is great to me. Keran C Kasonde Through this workshop I have been enabled to take time to read texts, observe by taking down the key words. Previously I left our meaningful things because little did I pay attention the details.","title":"Trip to Zambia"},{"categories":null,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"","keywords":null,"link":"/news/2023/week01/","tags":null,"text":"The Wry’s Family Updates Week 1 - January 1st, 2023 arrival to Cochabamba - Cell phone updates January 1st, 2023 Arrival After a few stops, we made it to Cochabamba along with all of our luggage! We were welcomed upon arriving at the house by Sonia and Señorita. Nelly’s brother Esteban and mother to follow shortly after. Upon seeing all the things from the center in the living room it became quickly apparent there was a lot of work to be done before classes could begin one month later. Cell Phone Updates and such It’s interesting to come back to Bolivia after being in North America for a little bit because you notice peculiar things that once you live in Bolivia for a while, become pretty day to day stuff. Every time we come back in we have to reconnect our cell phones to a Bolivian cellphone carrier. I had a phone I brought back with me from the US. It was not new and when I put in the new Bolivian SIM card it only worked for the first two minutes then showed no signal. My first thought was I will have to buy a new one. The suggestion was given however that I take it to a cell phone repair place and have them look it over. So, even though I doubted it would work we all went into town to at least give this option a try, hopefully saving money from buying a new phone. The first shop we stopped at asked me, “did you drop it?”. What a question. That’s like asking does a dog bark? Who hasn’t dropped their phone…? I paused a second before answering…ummm…(maybe it was a trick question?)…”yes” I replied realizing he was serious. “Oh…that’s bad, I’m going to need at least three days to repair it” was his reply. “How much?” I asked, his prompt reply, “350 Bolivianos”. So I went back out of the shop where Nelly and Joshua were waiting to discuss the option. It seemed way too much to pay to have a phone tampered with instead of just buying a new one. So, we decided to try out a second opinion. We headed to the next cell phone repair shop about a block away. “Oh”, was this young man’s return, “that’s no problem, give me an hour”. “How much” I enquired, “150 Bolivianos”. My reply, “can you do it for 100?”. He continued looking at the phone and replied, “let me see”. In the meantime we sat and waited. It’s usually not the best idea to leave your phone, that is, unless you don’t care about what they do to it. After an hour, a few screenshots and a bit of typing, he was done. “that will be 150 Bolivianos” he summoned, the looked up at me, “the hacker charged me 120, I only get 30”, he explained. Sure enough the phone was fixed, so off we went without asking questions. We had intended to go look for cars after that but my stomach was bothering me. Nelly pointed around the corner, “over there” she said, pointing towards a friend chicken restaurant. We went inside and not seeing a bathroom sign, went to the front counter and asked if we could use their bathroom. “It’s only for clients” was the ladies sturn reply. So we proceeded to buy a juice to share while I did my business. I went in back and asked for the bathroom. They pointed into a hallway so I (rather promptly) made my way there only to find it only contained a shower stall. By this time my stomach was really telling me it was time…or else…so I went back to ask where the bathroom was. Again they pointed toward the hallway but this time I could see they signaled to the other side of the hall where the door was almost impossible to spot as it was painted over just like the walls. I made a dash for the door, pried it open and proceeded to…well…you get the picture. Only, there was no toilet paper! Oh no, run back out, ask the “so very helpful attendant” for toilet paper only to be ignored, as if to say, “juice-buying clients are not entitled to toilet paper”. Thankfully, a young man, obviously seeing my desperation, reached in a bag and pulled out a handful of napkins. It turns out there were exactly 5. I was sure grateful for those napkins, even though they were not quite enough…oh well. Note to self: next time we return to Bolivia after being away a while, I shall take a bunch of TP with me in my back pocket and remember the location of this wonderful restaurant we are now “clients” of. Anyway, these are the funny things you don’t really notice after living in it for a while. Center and student residence Secured We are thankful that a place to have the center, and large enough to also serve as the student residence has been secured. It’s right next door to one of the church elder’s house! We still continue to search for a place nearby to live.","title":"Week 1"}]
