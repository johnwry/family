                    <description><![CDATA[<p>lo que me han sido de apoyo en mi caminar, algo en común - han sido discipulados</p>
<p><a href="verseid:40.4.19"><strong>Mat 4:19</strong> </a> Y les dijo*: «Vengan en pos de Mí, y Yo los haré pescadores de hombres».</p>
<p><a href="verseid:41.1.17"><strong>Mar 1:17</strong> </a> Y Jesús les dijo: «Vengan conmigo, y Yo haré que ustedes sean pescadores de hombres».</p>
<ul>
<li>el discipulado de Jesus no es como dejar tu legado</li>
<li>el discipulado de Jesus no es hacer seguidores
<ul>
<li>que no entienden, solo siguen</li>
<li>que solo copian</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>no es hacer estudios biblicos</li>
<li>el discipulado de Jesus no es hacer hombres letrados</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="verseid:44.4.13"><strong>Act 4:13</strong> </a> Al ver la confianza de Pedro y de Juan, y dándose cuenta de que eran hombres sin letras y sin preparación, se maravillaban, y reconocían que ellos habían estado con Jesús.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>escribieron el NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fundaron la iglesia</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vision-de-jesus">Vision de Jesus:</h2>
<p><a href="verseid:40.16.18"><strong>Mat 16:18</strong> </a> Yo también te digo que tú eres Pedro, y sobre esta roca edificaré Mi iglesia; y las puertas del Hades no prevalecerán contra ella.</p>
<h2 id="mision-de-jesus">Mision de Jesus:</h2>
<p><a href="verseid:40.28.18"><strong>Mat 28:18-20</strong> </a> Acercándose Jesús, les dijo: «Toda autoridad me ha sido dada en el cielo y en la tierra. Vayan, pues, y hagan discípulos de todas las naciones, bautizándolos en el nombre del Padre y del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo, enseñándoles a guardar todo lo que les he mandado; y ¡recuerden! Yo estoy con ustedes todos los días, hasta el fin del mundo».</p>
<h2 id="cc3d---un-año-intensivo">CC3D - un año intensivo</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>CC3D es un centro de entrenamiento de discipulado. Es un año intensivo, diseñado como un programa para preparar a jóvenes adultos para una vida de servicio a Jesucristo en la universidad, la carrera y más allá&quot;. El discipulado es costoso e implica entrenar, aprender e internalizar lo que se estudia de la Palabra de Dios para comunicarlo a otros. Hacer tareas, escribir papeles y tener plazos son todas habilidades para la vida que debes aprender. Esto es parte de tu desarrollo y entrenamiento, no solo para la vida, sino también para confiar en el Señor. Con la vida de Pedro, Jesús le permitió fallar muchas, muchas veces. El punto es este: creemos que <strong>a los estudiantes se les debe dar oportunidades para fallar</strong>. Necesitas que te den oportunidades para sentirte mal equipado. Necesitas experimentar situaciones que son incómodas o parecen imposibles. ¿De qué otra manera vas a aprender a confiar en Dios por lo imposible? Esta vida tendrá pruebas. Hacer el discipulado es en realidad inscribirse para más dificultades y pruebas, por lo que también podrías aprender eso desde el principio, donde tendrás un sistema de apoyo de creyentes para ayudarte a través de todo. Estamos aquí para ayudarte este año.</p>

<p>Recently we were invited for lunch to the Leyla’s. Juan and his wife are missionaries from Argentina and Juan is the director of Word of Life in Bolivia.</p>
<p>We met the Leylas years before at the church we both attended.</p>
<p>Recently our son Jg and their son Andres met at university and have become good friends.</p>

<p>In my role now as director of the 3D school in Cochabamba, I realize the contacts are important but moreso these opportunities can be turned into relationships with people that are beyond the ministerial liaisons.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for the connection but more hopeful in the friendship that might result centered around the person and work of Christ.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="discipleship">Discipleship</h1>
<h2 id="starting-at-home">Starting at home</h2>
<p>Our life has been very different these past few months due to extenuating circumstances. First we spent a couple of months just visiting family and friends. We were able to pick up a vehicle + RV combo and drive around the American countryside&hellip;that was fun!</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.cc3d.org/index.php/apps/cms_pico/pico/wry-web/assets/josh.jpeg" width="300">  Following this time, God opened the doors for us to be able to go to 3DTC in Beaumont, Texas. Our time there started in September and went until the 10th of December.  Nelly and I traded places during this time. I was able to stay at home while she went to study full-time at 3D. By study full-time I mean 8:00am to 5:00pm with a short lunch break.</p>
<p>God uses amazing methods to teach us (if we&rsquo;re teachable).  We want to be teachable. In fact, we realize we need to be teachable, however we&rsquo;re not always with the correct mindset to be taught and lessons are missed or delayed it seems.</p>
<p>During this time God prepared a special lesson for me. It all took place at home with our son, Joshua. He is in first grade, going on high-school&hellip;except he can&rsquo;t read so much and hates writing his letters.  Actually that sounds familiar to me as a high-school student.</p>
<p>The thing is, it was my turn to homeschool Joshua. Usually Nelly does the teaching at home and excels at it while keeping the home in tip-top shape. I am not really sure how she does it all - maybe she&rsquo;s not all human.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to school with Joshua&hellip;it was such a learning experience&hellip;for me. I hope he learned a bit too but mostly, I believe, it was me learning. Not only was I educated in how much kids learn these days in first grade but the online method as well. I remember programming our Learning Management System back in Red Biblica days and though it was ahead in its time, online learning these days has progressed so far.</p>
<p>The point it, this new environment I was in was the perfect setting for me to learn a very important lesson. Discipleship should begin at home. Why? Because so many foundations are laid in first grade, even earlier. Concepts like nouns, verbs, counting, summing and addition are some of the blocks that are set in place. To the degree in which they are understood will greatly determine the future ability to build on later.</p>
<p>At the same time, and being christians, we try to teach our children about the Bible. Yet it has become evident to me of the confusions that are laid at this very early age. Bible stories are actually taught as human heroes to become like. Jesus is taught as the one to imitate in His perfections and the Fruit of the Spirit is set as something attainable if we want it hard enough.  So, it&rsquo;s no wonder when we were discussing going to Heaven with my son, his answer revealed his dependence on his goodness (efforts to be good) and eternal life was a reward.</p>
<p>I learned how important it is to disciple our kids early on. Let&rsquo;s not presume that just because our kids give us the right answers regarding David and Goliath or Noah and the ark or God in creation that they understand the basics of God&rsquo;s perfect character, love and justice and our (children included) sinfulness and need for a savior. The Gospel is not a magical phrase kids repeat or memorize as a first grade lesson. It requires understanding the purpose for the Gospel, the cost of the Gospel and the results of believing the Gospel.</p>
<p>Teaching Bible stories with the purpose of teaching heroes to behave like is confusing if one does not understand the basics that need to be laid early on.  You don&rsquo;t learn about summing numbers before you learn to count. It is senseless to think sentences can be formed before learning letters. In the same way, I learned that my job as a parent begins early on, presenting building blocks of life that later will be built on. Our christian education is presuming too much if they think teaching the Fruit of the Spirit to first graders as the way to behave. It&rsquo;s like starting with equations before learning greater than, less than or equal to. The basic concepts need to be laid first before talking about how a christian should live. Equations are taught upon basic concepts not something to memorize and repeat.</p>
<p>So to sum this up, I have come to realize that the reason much of our discipleship training at the 3D center is unteaching and removing false understandings that have been incorrectly taught in church. This is why young people are better trained that adults unfortunately. It&rsquo;s because adults have so much more they have learned that is incorrect. I am an excelent example of this. I was serving with all my heart as a missionary without even clearly understanding the gospel message.</p>
<p>Clarity of the gospel does not come by chance. It does not come by using cliche&rsquo;s that allude to truth for fear of not offending anyone. Placing trust on someone to bump into truth on their own is only leading people astray. Discipleship is not so much about ability or talent but about trust in the God of the message.</p>
<p>Discipleship needs to start laying out concepts before memorizing christian phrases. Christian phrases can be built upon concepts like equations are built on the concept of greater than or less than. Unless we teach concepts we are setting up kids to be deaf to understanding and all too familiar with meaningless words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for this time of learning. I pray that I can learn to apply this, especially in the lives of my children and that I will not presume they understand concepts just because they give the right answers.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://thewrys.redbiblica.org/jesus-in-the-bible/">March 28, 2020</a> by <a href="https://thewrys.redbiblica.org/author/johnwry/">John Wry</a></p>
<h2 id="is-christ-central-to-the-scriptures">Is Christ central to the Scriptures</h2>
<p>The Holy Scriptures, the Bible is a compilation of 66 books written over a period of about 1500 years (1400BC – 95AD). Penned by over 40 people in 3 different languages from varied walks of life and living under different circumstances; in wealth, in poverty, in prison, in the palace, in Greece, in Jerusalem, in Babylon and everywhere in between. The amazing thing is that although there are many writers there are no contradictions. One central message and everyone is agreed on that.</p>
<p>Jesus says He was written about by Moses, in the Pentateuch. [Galatians 3:24](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gal">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gal</a> 3.24) states the Law was a tutor to lead us to Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn over all creation.
For everything was created <strong>by Him,</strong>
in heaven and on earth,
the visible and the invisible,
whether thrones or dominions
or rulers or authorities—
all things have been created <strong>through Him</strong> and <strong>for Him</strong>.
He is before all things,
and by Him all things hold together.</p>
<p>[Colossians 1:15-17 HCSB](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/hcsb/Col">https://biblia.com/bible/hcsb/Col</a> 1.15-17)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What did Jesus say about Himself in the Scriptures?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish <strong>but to fulfill.</strong> For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</p>
<p>[Matthew 5:17-18](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt</a> 5.17-18)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is <strong>these that bear witness of me</strong> . . . For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; <strong>for he wrote of me</strong>.</p>
<p>[John 5:39](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John</a> 5.39), [46](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John</a> 5.46)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And He answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: <em>the</em> BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, <em>the</em> lame walk, <em>the</em> lepers are cleansed, and <em>the</em> deaf hear, <em>the</em> dead are raised up, <em>the</em> POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.</p>
<p>[Luke 7:22](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke</a> 7.22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse clearly shows that He is the One who came to fulfill Scripture. There are hundreds of prophesies about Christ, most have been fulfilled. They have always been fulfilled literally. Therefore it is to presume that future prophesies will also be fulfilled literally to fulfill what the Scriptures say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, <strong>that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.</strong>” Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</p>
<p>[Luke 24:44-45](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke</a> 24.44-45)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-prophets">The Prophets</h2>
<h2 id="the-psalms">The Psalms</h2>
<p>We saw earlier that the first five books talk about Christ. What Psalms is He talking about here? It seems rather subjective to pick verses in the Psalms, because they are in the poetic genre. Many verses sound like it could be Jesus but who’s to say they aren’t just talking about something similar?. Can we know for sure? I submit to you we most certainly can because the New Testament Scriptures comment on the Psalms.</p>
<p>Psalm 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 51, 53, 55, 62, 68, 69, 72, 78, 82, etc etc…clic below to see a list.</p>

<p>How can we know, for instance, Psalm 22 is specifically about Christ?</p>
<p>[Psalm 22:1](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps</a> 22.1) is fulfilled by Jesus and written down by [Matthew 27:46](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt</a> 27.46). Perhaps at this point saying that just because Jesus said those words they have to be prophetic. But, Psalm 22 is quoted all through the New Testament and used in reference to Christ. [Psalm 22:7](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps</a> 22.7) is quoted and fulfilled in [Matthew 27:43](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt</a> 27.43). [Psalm 22:18](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps</a> 22.18) is quoted and fulfilled and recorded in all 4 Gospel accounts. [Psalm 22:16-17](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps</a> 22.16-17) is quoted and fulfilled by Christ and written in John. [Psalm 22:22](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps</a> 22.22) is quoted in [Heb 2:12](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb</a> 2.12) referring to Christ.</p>
<h2 id="the-exilic-books">The exilic books</h2>
<p>Daniel, Ezekiel and Zachariah and Jeremiah are full of prophecies regarding Christ’s first coming and second coming and new covenant promises to Israel fulfilled literally on earth through Christ. We see the glorified Christ.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-testament">The New Testament</h2>
<p>He is the Word (logos) ([John 1:1-3](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John</a> 1.1-3)). ([John 5:39](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John</a> 5.39), [46](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John</a> 5.46))</p>
<p>The Gospel – which is about Christ and His work of dying on the cross for our sins and rising again is according to the Scriptures ([1 Cor 15:1-4](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/1</a> Cor 15.1-4)).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit was sent to us to teach us all things pertinent to Christ and the Father. He works hand in hand with the Scriptures.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I doubt it could be stressed enough though, the Scriptures are all about Christ from beginning to end. The Scriptures are the means to know Christ by the teaching of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself <strong>in all the Scriptures.</strong></p>
<p>[Luke 24:27](<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke">https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Luke</a> 24.27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how do you view the Bible? Is Jesus the central figure? To truly know and understand the Scriptures is to know Christ since they Scriptures teach us of Him.</p>
